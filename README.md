**API and scraper share one Docker image** — the scraper is a separate Railway service with a different `startCommand`. One build pipeline, zero drift between environments.

## Technical highlights

### 1. Backtracking CSP solver with MRV ordering

The naive approach — `itertools.product` over all section combinations — materialises up to 15⁸ ≈ 2.5 billion candidates before checking a single conflict. That's a non-starter.

The solver uses iterative backtracking with **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) ordering**: the course with the fewest valid sections is assigned first. A course with 2 candidates at the root of the search tree prunes entire subtrees that would otherwise be explored at every level. In practice this reduces explored nodes by 10–100× on typical 3–5 course inputs.

A hard **800ms wall-clock deadline** is enforced every 500 nodes via `monotonic_ns()`. The check is amortised — calling it every 500 nodes costs ~0.2µs per 2,000 nodes instead of ~100µs for every-node checks. When the budget expires, the solver returns whatever results it found plus a truncation warning rather than a 500.

```python
SOLVE_TIME_BUDGET_MS = 800
MAX_COURSES = 8
EXPLORE_LIMIT = 25   # stop after finding this many; rank and return top 10
NODE_CHECK_INTERVAL = 500
```

### 2. Minute-of-week integers for conflict detection

On the solver's hot path, `sections_conflict(a, b)` is called millions of times on adversarial inputs. It can't afford datetime parsing or set intersection.

Each meeting is pre-expanded at load time to a `(start_mow, end_mow)` integer pair using day offsets (Monday = 0, Tuesday = 1440, Wednesday = 2880, …). Conflict detection reduces to a single predicate:

```python
a.start < b.end and b.start < a.end
```

Day separation falls out of the arithmetic for free — Monday 10:00 = minute 600, Wednesday 10:00 = minute 3480. Multi-meeting sections (TR lecture + F lab) expand to one interval per day; any overlap with any interval is detected without special-casing.

### 3. Deterministic PDF parsing with pdfplumber + regex

The DegreeWorks parser could have been an LLM call. It isn't, for three reasons:

- **Determinism**: the same PDF always produces the same output. LLM responses vary — you can't write regression tests that pin parser output to specific inputs.
- **Failure mode**: when regex misses a requirement, `validate_parsed_degree` catches the credit inconsistency and returns a 422. When an LLM hallucinates a course code, it returns a plausible-looking wrong result that passes validation and silently generates a wrong graduation plan.
- **Cost**: ~$0.01–0.05 per parse × registration-week volume is a meaningful recurring cost for a free student tool.

pdfplumber extracts text column-by-column from DegreeWorks' fixed-format PDF. Compiled regex patterns extract each field. A `ParsedDegreeValidated` subtype — only ever instantiated inside `validate_parsed_degree()` — enforces that downstream functions only receive validated data:

```python
def generate_plan(degree: ParsedDegreeValidated) -> ...:  # type error to pass raw ParsedDegree
```

### 4. PostgreSQL advisory lock for scraper concurrency

A scrape during registration week can take longer than 30 minutes (Banner slows under load). Without a guard, the next Railway cron fires while the first run is still in progress — doubling the Banner request rate and creating race conditions on the `DELETE + INSERT` in the meetings table.

The guard uses `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` (transaction-level), not `pg_try_advisory_lock` (session-level). Session-level locks are tied to the underlying connection — asyncpg returns connections to the pool between operations, which can silently release a session lock mid-scrape. Transaction-level locks release on commit or rollback, a boundary that's explicitly controlled.

### 5. Scraper error taxonomy

The Banner scraper distinguishes two non-retriable failure classes:

- **`BannerBlockedError`** (403): log and continue to the next subject. One blocked subject doesn't mean all subjects are blocked.
- **`BannerSchemaError`** (unexpected JSON structure): abort all remaining subjects. A Banner schema change from an Ellucian upgrade affects the entire instance — processing further subjects would write corrupt data.

Network timeouts are retriable with `[5, 15, 30]` second backoff. Retrying a 403 against the same blocked IP (the old behaviour) wasted time and kept a hot connection to a system that had already flagged it.

### 6. Design system built on CSS tokens

The UI targets a specific aesthetic: Linear's layout and density, Vercel's data-heavy tables, Raycast's command-palette interaction. The design is enforced through a Tailwind token layer — no raw color classes anywhere in the codebase.

```css
/* Every color in the app lives here */
--color-bg:       #0A0A0A;
--color-surface:  #111111;
--color-njit-red: #D22630;
```

Every course code, CRN, time, and room number uses `font-mono`. This is the app's visual signature and is non-negotiable in code review.

## Architectural decisions

Over 20 ADRs are documented in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md), covering every significant choice from the solver algorithm to the PDF parsing strategy to the color palette. A few worth reading:

- **ADR-5/6/7**: Why backtracking CSP beats brute-force product, why MRV ordering, why 800ms
- **ADR-8**: Minute-of-week integers — why two integer comparisons beats day-string set intersection on the hot path
- **ADR-9**: Why pdfplumber + regex beats Claude for DegreeWorks parsing
- **ADR-3**: Why transaction-level advisory locks instead of session-level with asyncpg
- **ADR-4**: The scraper error taxonomy and why 403s must not be retried
